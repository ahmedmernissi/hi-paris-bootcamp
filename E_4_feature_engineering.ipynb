    "===================\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it important ?\n",
    "To undertand the objectives of this Lab, we first need to understand what is a machine learning model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a machine learning model can be summarized in finding a link function $f$\n",
    " ($Y=f(X) + \\epsilon$) which is most often the\n",
    "result of error minimization : <p style=\"text-align: center;\">$\\sum_i E(Y_i,f(X_i))$</p> where\n",
    "$(X_i,Y_i)$ is a list of pairs (features, target).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, features $(X_i)$ are key contributors to the success of a model.\n",
    "The process of creating new features, that will be used to train a model, is called **feature engineering**\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### What is Feature Engineering ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is the process by which knowledge of data is used to construct explanatory variables, features, that can be used to train a predictive model. Engineering and selecting the correct features for a model will not only significantly improve its predictive power, but will also offer the flexibility to use less complex models that are faster to run and more easily understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is it done ?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Engineering from Datetime\n",
    "The timestamp in itself is not a feature that can be taken into consideration, but we can extract from it numerical features. Ex: day of the week.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# to get the day of week from a datetime column in a DataFrame, you can use:\n",
    "df[\"day_of_week\"] = df[\"date\"].dt.dayofweek\n",
    "\n",
    "# to get the day of month from a datetime column in a DataFrame, you can use:\n",
    "df[\"day\"] = df[\"date\"].dt.day\n",
    "\n",
    "# to get the month from a datetime column in a DataFrame, you can use:\n",
    "df[\"month\"] = df[\"date\"].dt.month\n",
    "```\n",
    "More documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.dt.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Engineering from transformations\n",
    "Feature transformations can include aggregating, or combining transforming attributes to create new features. Useful and relevant features will depend on the problem at hand but averages, sums, log or ratios can better expose trends to a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also transform a numerical feature into a categorical feature by cutting it into classes. This can be interesting to avoid the impact of outliers or to reduce the variance of the output variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# sum 2 numerical columns (works similarly for all classical operators)\n",
    "df['A+B'] = df['A'] + df['B']\n",
    "\n",
    "# log transformation\n",
    "df['var_transformed'] = df['var'].apply(np.log)\n",
    "\n",
    "# polynomial transformation\n",
    "df['var_transformed'] = df['var']**2\n",

    "### Data Encoding\n",
    "Some algorithms can't work with categorical data directly. This means that categorical data must be converted to a numerical type. One way of doing so is to use One-Hot Encoding. It consists in transforming one column with N categorical data into N columns with 1 and 0. Each categorical value gets one column, and an observation has a 1 in the column if its original categorical value was its column (see example below)"

    "Objectives of this lab\n",
    "======\n",
    "\n",
    "Use feature engineering to add new relevant features for your predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Information:**\n",
    "- as a reminder, predictions will be based on a given state, at a given day. Ex: will there be a fire on the June 15th, 2015 in Arizona ?\n",
    "- Consequently, all features should be expressed for a given state, at a given day.\n",
    "- 2 datasets will be used as a starting point:\n",
    "    - a cleaned dataset with all fires observed between 2011 and 2014 in the US `./data/2_clean/fires.csv`.\n",
    "    - a cleaned dataset with external data (demographics, temperature and precipitation) `./data/2_clean/external_data.csv`\n",
    "- most of the features that you will create will consist in manipulating pandas DataFrames (creating new columns, and aggregating a result for a given state at a given date).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hypothesis for the model\n",
    "\n",
    "**As an hypothesis** you can use all available external data (temperature, demographics, precipitation) for your predictions. For example, when you will predict if there is a fire in Arizone in June 15th, 2015, you can use the temperature that was observed in June 15th, 2015. This hypothesis reflects the fact we are confident in weather forecasts, and that the final model can be used few weeks before the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However** you only have the history of fires until Dec. 2014. As a consequence, and because you will predict fires up until Dec 31st, 2015, you cannot create features that will use data (from this history of fires) 1 year before the prediction date. For example, if you need to predict the appearence of a fire in June 15th, 2015, you cannot use the history of fires after June 16th, 2014. This hypothesis reflects the needed time to centralize data accross all states and federal agencies, that can take up to 1 year."

    "- create features for the dataset `./data/2_clean/external_data.csv`\n",
    "    - you can create/use the function `feature_engineering_external_data` to do so. New features can be:\n",
    "        - **average maximum temperature** for all available cities inside a state, at a given date\n",
    "        - **average minimum temperature** for all available cities inside a state, at a given date\n",
    "        - **delta** between min and max temperatures\n",
    "        - **average precipitation** for all available cities inside a state, at a given date\n",
    "        - among an infinity of possibilities ! Be creative !\n",
    "    - One row of the output DataFrame will correspond to a state, at a given date, with the computed features\n",
    "- create features for the dataset `./data/2_clean/fires.csv`\n",
    "    - you can create/use the function `feature_engineering_fires` to do so.\n",
    "        - **number of fires in the state 2 years before**\n",
    "        - **number of fires in the state, 1 year before, in a 1 month time window**. For example, if the prediction date is June 16th, 2014, you can compute the number of fires that occured between May 16th, 2013 and June 16th, 2013.\n",
    "            - you can vary the time window to add more features to your model.\n",
    "        - among an infinity of possibilities ! Be creative !\n",
    "    - One row of the output DataFrame will correspond to a state, at a given date, with the computed features\n",
    "- merge the above 2 datasets into a single one\n",
    "    - One can use the function [pd.merge()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html) to do so.\n",
    "- clean this dataset (if needed) and save the result to `./data/3_input_model/input_model.csv`\n",
    "- a final section in this notebook allows you to test the performance of your feature engineering, based on a simple random forest. It allows you to see the performance of your feature engineering, by plotting the features and their importance when doing predictions."
